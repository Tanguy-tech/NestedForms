This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

⚙️ Ruby version 2.5.1

This is a test application implementing Nested forms.
This enables more than one model to be combined in forms while maintaining the same basic code pattern with simple single model form. Nested attributes allow attributes to be saved through the parent on associated records. The updating of the nested attribute is turned off by default and can be enabled using the class method ‘accepts_nested_attributes_for’.

It creates a scope around a specific model object like ‘form_for’ , but doesn’t create the form tags themselves. This makes ‘fields_for’ suitable for specifying additional model objects in the same form. Although the usage and purpose of ‘field_for’ is similar to ‘form_for’, its method signature is slightly different. Like ‘form_for’ , it yields a FormBuilder object associated with a particular model object to a block, and within the block allows methods to be called on the builder to generate fields associated with the model object.
